Developed a machine learning model to predict medical insurance costs based on individual attributes like age, BMI, 
smoking status, and region. Collected and cleaned data, performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applied 
feature encoding and normalization. Trained and evaluated multiple regression models using Scikit-learn, selecting 
the best-performing one based on accuracy metrics. Visualized key insights and model performance to support 
prediction reliability.
