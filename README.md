Project title - Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

May 2025 - Jun 2025 Remote, Andhra Pradesh 
Developed a machine learning model to predict medical insurance costs based on individual attributes like age, BMI, 
smoking status, and region. Collected and cleaned data, performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applied 
feature encoding and normalization. Trained and evaluated multiple regression models using Scikit-learn, selecting 
the best-performing one based on accuracy metrics. Visualized key insights and model performance to support 
prediction reliability. 


about the project - Rising healthcare costs cause financial burden on individuals, families, and insurers.Insurance providers need accurate cost predictions to set fair premiums.Predict individual medical insurance charges using demographic and health features without presenting solutions.

Data Collection: Use dataset with age, sex, BMI, children, smoker status, region, and charges kaggle.com+7kaggle.com+7github.com+7kaggle.com+9huggingface.co+9researchgate.net+9 Feature Engineering: Encode categorical variables (sex, smoker, region), scale numeric features. Modeling: Compare regression algorithms—Linear, Ridge, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting. Evaluation: Use metrics such as R², MAE, RMSE.

Machine‑learning models can effectively predict insurance charges using demographic data. Gradient Boosting Regression consistently performed best (R² ≈ 0.86–0.89), outperforming linear and tree-based models arxiv.org+12ijraset.com+12kaggle.com+12 Top predictors include smoking status, BMI, and age Insightful for insurers to set premiums and help individuals estimate costs
